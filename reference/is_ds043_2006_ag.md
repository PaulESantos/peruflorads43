# Matching for DS 043-2006-AG Species

Performs consolidated matching that searches species names in both the
original DS 043-2006-AG list (2006 names) and the updated nomenclature
database. This ensures that users with updated names can still identify
if their species are protected under the DS 043-2006-AG, even if the
nomenclature has updated.

## Usage

``` r
is_ds043_2006_ag(splist, prioritize = "original", return_details = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- splist:

  Character vector of species names to check

- prioritize:

  Character. Which result to prioritize when both databases match:
  "original" (default) or "updated"

- return_details:

  Logical. Return detailed matching information

## Value

If return_details = FALSE: Character vector with consolidated threat
status. If return_details = TRUE: Tibble with detailed reconciliation
information.

## Details

The function performs a two-stage search:

1\. Searches in original DS 043-2006-AG (names as listed in 2006) 2.
Searches in updated nomenclature database (current accepted names) 3.
Consolidates results with clear indication of which database provided
the match 4. Identifies if original names are now synonyms

This approach handles cases where: - User provides original name from
2006: Found in original database - User provides updated name: Found in
updated database and linked to DS 043-2006-AG list - Name matches in
both: Returns most relevant result based on priority - Original name is
now a synonym: Indicated with "(synonym)" marker

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Species with nomenclatural changes
species <- c(
  "Haageocereus acranthus subsp. olowinskianus",  # Original name
  "Brassia ocanensis",                            # Updated name (was Ada)
  "Ida locusta",                                  # Updated name
  "Lycaste locusta",                              # Now a synonym
  "Persea americana"                              # Not threatened
)

# Get consolidated status
status <- is_ds043_2006_ag(species)

# Get detailed information
details <- is_ds043_2006_ag(species, return_details = TRUE)
View(details)
} # }
```
